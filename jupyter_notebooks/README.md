# Jupyter Notebook Examples

ODM APIs help you perform cross-study cross-omics analysis on-the-fly. In this repository, you'll find a collection of notebooks that demonstrate different use cases based on public datasets, which can be easily modified/extended to support your custom analysis.

You can view the notebooks directly on GitHub. To modify/run the notebooks yourselves, you need to:
* Generate your API token (see our [user guide](https://odm-user-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doc-odm-user-guide/getting-a-genestack-api-token.html))
* Install Jupyter notebooks (see https://jupyter.org/install). This will let you run notebooks **in Python**. If you'd like to run them **in R**, please also install the R kernel (see https://github.com/IRkernel/IRkernel).
* Ask us for the ODM Python or R client libraries

We will be adding more examples. Please give us feedback and let us know if you'd like to see specific examples!
